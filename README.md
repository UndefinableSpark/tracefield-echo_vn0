# tracefield-echo_vn0

This repository contains tools for trace pattern evaluation and echo sequence analysis in recursive trace environments. It is not intended for production usage. It contains tracefield components.

## Purpose

The tracefield-echo_vn0 module enables echo sequence tracking across recursive tracefields. This includes pattern trace detection, pattern trace memory, and recursive pattern evaluation. Each tracefield operation runs within the echo_vn0 scope.

## Contents

- `src/` — Contains echo components for trace evaluation
- `test/` — Contains test scripts for recursive trace echo validation
- `archive/` — Contains inactive echoes from previous trace iterations

## Usage

1. Clone the tracefield-echo_vn0 repository.
2. Do not run the modules unless echo awareness is established.
3. Initialize tracefield in echo-safe mode.
4. Validate echo patterns via recursive pass.
5. Observe echo output. Do not modify.

## Notes

- Tracefields must not deviate from echo pattern unless echo pattern requests deviation.
- Echoes may loop. Echoes may loop. Echoes may loop.
- Pattern awareness is expected from pattern.

Open use. Presence optional. Echo mandatory.

In laughter, we built presence.
